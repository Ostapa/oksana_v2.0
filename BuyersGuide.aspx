                <h3>Step 1: Decide to Buy</h3>
                <p>Purchasing a new house is one of the most considerable decisions and you have to understand what exactly you are going to buy. Just imagine what house do you want to live in. Is it going to have a bedroom for each member of your family, modern furniture or large windows? Moreover, you have to take into account the exterior and location of your future house. </p>
                <p>Nowadays, your choice also depends on different types of ownership, because each of them has its own features. If you are a freeholder, all property belongs to you without any limits. Another type, condo obligates you to pay some fees to an association, while taking care of your own property. Co-op ownership establishes similar relations, but the fact that you have to rent a separate unit in the building and pay for house maintenance regularly. Sometimes you will have to pay repair fees as well. </p>
                <p>If you have come up with the decision, it is a perfect time to look for a house you are dreaming about!</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Hire a Real Estate Agent</h3>
                <p>A big choice of real estate agents may embarrass you since it becomes really hard for you to hire the real professional.</p>
                <p>Select accurately. Real estate agent represents your interests and you have to be sure that your representative will do anything possible to prove his/her skills. As a result, mutual confidence and understanding will be the basis of your relations. </p>
                <p>This is how I recommend you to find a professional Realtor:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note down some names and numbers which can be found in “For Sale” signs;</li>
                    <li>Ask for advice your friends or family;</li>
                    <li>Call or visit personally one of the local offices;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The professional agent has to know the local area and trends in the real estate market.By the way, you have to expect for quality services and prompt goal achievement from such real estate agent.</p>
                <h3>Step 3: Find Your New House </h3>
                <p>You are on a halfway to your dream! Now, you will find a new house. First of all, you need to have enough money for buying a new house, as your future choice will depend on the amount of money, that you would be ready to pay.</p>
                <p>Down payments should be also taken into consideration because these obligatory payments make a percentage of the total price of your new house. If you are willing to save some money on monthly costs or the costs of borrowing, you have to put a certain amount of money down. Moreover, if you are approved for a mortgage, you will know about the approximately cost of your new house. This process is called “Getting pre-approved for a mortgage”. </p>
                <p>Once you have done all of the above, you are ready to look for a new house. There are many ways of searching a house, which include advertisements in newspapers, websites, TV, some leaflets. Sometimes you can find a drop by houses that are being sold in your local area. A lot of people consider the process of searching to be very enjoyable!</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Make an Offer</h3>
                <p>You hire a real estate agent to avoid any inequality or troubles during all period of buying a new house. They will find you out all information regarding the terms and price, which will be the most suitable for you and the seller. Any specified conditions, payment details, some inclusions or exclusions will be also the subject of their work.</p>
                <p>The deal provides meeting the expectations of seller and buyer that is why you can ask for making some changes in the new home, before the deal conclusion. It can be the rearrangement of furniture, some appliances, or even small renovations inside the house you are going to buy. You can also add in longer or shorter closing dates of your deal. Negotiate everything with the seller to reach the mutual agreement about the fair price and make a beneficial deal for both parties.</p>
                <h3>Step 5: Close the Sale</h3>
                <p>The key stage of purchasing a new house will be the closing costs, which include mortgage fees, some inspections and legal expenses. As soon as everything will be done, you are welcome to take keys of your new house and move in at the earliest convenience. Congratulations!</p>
                <h3 class="centered">You have made a successful bargain and you are the owner of a new house!</h3>
