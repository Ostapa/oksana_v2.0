                <h3>The size of a down payment may differ.</h3>
                <p>According to the type of mortgage, you will have to pay additionally from 5% to 20% of the purchase price. That kind of payment is called down payment. Conventional mortgage obligates buyers to put down not less than 20% of the purchase price or estimated value, whichever is less, as a down payment. A high-ratio mortgage is a solution for those buyers, who have a lack of money to cover this 20 % down payment. This way you will have to put down only 5% down payment and get default insurance.</p>
                <p>As a result, choosing one of these down payments will have different consequences. But it is obviously that you will save more money if you are ready to put down larger down payment. </p>
                <h3>For sure, larger down payment has its’ own advantages including:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>reduced total amount of interest that you will pay over the life of your mortgage</li>
                    <li>reduced amount of your monthly principal and interest payments.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Ask about the RSP Home Buyers’ Plan</h3>
                <p>The RSP Home Buyers’ Plan or HBP affords buyers to call away to $25,000 from RSPs for purchasing a first home. This amount should be returned during the next 15 years providing that you will have to repay annually at least 1/15 of the amount withdrawn.</p>
                <p>For example, if you withdraw all the $25,000, accordingly the annual repayment will be $1,333. If you are unable to pay the annual minimum, the balance is added to the taxpayer’s income.</p>
                <h3>Insuring High-Ratio Mortgage</h3>
                <p>CMHC or Genworth Financial can compensate a mortgage for up to 95% of the house lending value. In addition to this, you are not going to pay a large down payment. Anyone who is going to buy a house in Canada with the intention to use it as a principal residence will be included by eligible borrowers.   </p>
                <p>The government cannot ensure mortgage to homes with a value of $1,000000 or less. Each buyer has a possibility to use up to 39% of gross family income to pay for mortgage principal and interest, property taxes and utilities. </p>
